## Goal
<p>Understand and practice interview questions with time complexity constraint </p>

## Questions
### sumZero
Write a function called sumZero which accepts a sorted
array of integers. The function should find the first pair
where the sum is O. Return an array that includes both
values that sum to zero or undefined if pair does not exist

### averagePair
Write a function called averagePair. Given a sorted array of integers and a target average,
determine if there is a pair of values in the array where the average of the pair equals the
target average.
There may be more than one pair that matches the average target.


### maxSubArraySum
Given an array of integers and a number, write a function called maxSubarraySum, which finds
the maximum sum of a subarray with the length of the number passed to the function.
Note that a subarray must consist of consecutive elements from the original array.
example below, [100, 200, 300] is a subarray of the original array, but [100, 300] is not.


### minSubArrayLen
Write a function called minSubArrayLen which accepts two parameters - an array of positive
integers and a positive integer.
This function should return the minimal length of a contiguous subarray of which the sum is
greater than or equal to the integer passed to the function. If there isn't one, return O instead.
Examples:

### add-two-numbers 
You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers. The digits are stored in reverse order, and each of their nodes contains a single digit. Add the two numbers and return the sum as a linked list.
You may assume the two numbers do not contain any leading zero, except the number 0 itself.

### findMedianSortedArray
Given two sorted arrays nums1 and nums2 of size m and n respectively, 
return the median of the two sorted arrays.
The overall run time complexity should be O(log (m+n)).
